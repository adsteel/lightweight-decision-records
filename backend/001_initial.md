# Backend Initial LDR

In our engineering organization, the backend functional team makes decisions about significant architecture pattens via lightweight decision records (LDRs).

## What is an LDR?

A backend LDR is similar to an RFC (request for comment). It is a documentation-driven approach to architecture design for backend systems. Proposed LDRs are opened as Pull Requests, where the team dissects, discusses, and revises the proposal, then ultimately accepts or rejects it. Accepted LDRs are merged and serve as documentation for the how & why of a given architecure.
