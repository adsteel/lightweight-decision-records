# Lightweight Decision Records Repo Example

A very basic example of a possible directory and LDR structure.

The hierarchy here is engineering-architecture-roundtable -> functional teams, so to start at the [first EAR LDR](./engineering-architecture-roundtable/001_initial.md).

For documentation patterns, start at the [General Documentation LDR](./engineering-architecture-roundtable/002_general_documentation.md).
