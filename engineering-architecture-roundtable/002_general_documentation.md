# General Documentaion

## Overview

Our engineering organization has an increasing complex set of domains and codebases that we oversee. Engineers often have to (re)ramp up in new areas of expertise, from onboarding to switching teams to executing on cross-team initiatives. To facilitate these goals, we prioritize documentation as a first class citizen.

## Solution

There are many types of documentation we will need to write to achieve our goals. It would not make sense to attempt to catalogue them all here. Future LDRs at the EAR and functional team levels should define the types and their requirements. This LDR outlines the common requirements for each documentation type.

When creating a new documentation LDR, the following questions should be answered:

- What is the goal of the documentation?
- Who is the audience?
- What format should it take?
- Are there any preferred patterns or templates?
- What location should it live in?
- Are diagrams required?
- Are diagram technologies restricted?
- Who owns the documentation, and is responsible for its maintenance?
- How are new contributions to the documentation made?
- What are examples of this type of documentation?
- Is there any additional context needed?
