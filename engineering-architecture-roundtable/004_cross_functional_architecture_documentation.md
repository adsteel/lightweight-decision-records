# Cross Functional Architecture Documentaion

## What is the goal of the documentation?

To provide a clear process for introducing ideas, discussion, decision, and record of cross-functional architecture decisions. Cross-functional in this case means any architectural pattern that will have implications that cross functional team boundaries, e.g. API access patterns.

## Who is the audience?

All engineering organization members.

## What location should it live in?

In this folder in this repo.

## What format should it take?

Use the template in this folder.

## Are diagrams required?

As a general rule, diagrams should be included.

## Are diagram technologies restricted?

No technology restrictions, but prioritize diagram maintainability by future authors. Consider the cost of updating a jpg of a diagram someone else made, or embedding a diagram that no one else has the permission to edit.

Our preferred technologies are mermaidjs and lucidcharts.

## Who owns the documentation and is responsible for its maintenance?

The EAR.
