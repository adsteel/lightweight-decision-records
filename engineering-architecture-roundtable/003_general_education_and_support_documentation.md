# General Education and Support Documentation

## What is the goal of the documentation?

To provide more general education and/or support resources in an accessible format.

## Who is the audience?

Anyone who is not a domain expert. This may include other technical teams, onboarding engineers, or even non-technical roles as appropriate.

## What location should it live in?

Gen ed and support docs should live in within the owning team's Confluence space. If other teams also want that documentation in their space they can link to or embed the owning team's pages.

## What format should it take?

Unless you have strong opinions otherwise, we recommend following the [divio](https://documentation.divio.com/introduction/) patterns for documentation. Choose as many of the 4 categories as make sense for your use case.

## Are diagrams required?

Diagrams should be included where they would help the reader understand.

## Are diagram technologies restricted?

No technology restrictions, but prioritize diagram maintainability by future authors. Consider the cost of updating a jpg of a diagram someone else made, or embedding a diagram that no one else has the permission to edit.

## Who owns the documentation and is responsible for its maintenance?

The team of domain experts.

## How are new contributions to the documentation made?

The team of domain experts should decide on the process that works well for them.

## What are examples of this type of documentation?

- Onboarding resources for a given squad
- Security information resources & guidelines, written by the platform team, stored in the platform Team's confluence, and linked to in other teams' onboarding resources.
- On call runbooks for a given squad, in a dedicated folder in that squad's Confluence page

## Is there any additional context needed?
